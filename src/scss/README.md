# svbstrate [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/svbstrate.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svbstrate)

### A simple, scalable CSS base layer. 
A low-level CSS library written in SCSS, inspired by [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). Many thanks to Brent and Adam. Please check out the [docs site](http://estrattonbailey.com/svbstrate-site/) (WIP) for an overview of what's here. 

## Getting Started 
Svbstrate is hosted on NPM, so simply install the package to your project and copy the files to your stylesheet directory.

1. Install from NPM.

  ```
  npm i svbstrate --save
  ```

2. Copy files from `node_modules/svbsrate/src` into your stylesheet directory.

**Alternatively,** you can install svbstrate as a global module, and make use of its CLI tool.

1. Install globally.

  ```
  npm i svbstrate -g
  ```

2. Init a new project, replacing `<path>` with the path to your desired stylesheets directory.

  ```
  svbstrate init <path>
  ```
